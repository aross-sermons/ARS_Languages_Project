            <p>C Sharp (C#) is a an <em>open-source</em>, object oriented version of the C++ language. It was <strong>created in 2000 by Anders Hejlsberg</strong>, who still leads the program's development at Microsoft. It was created as part of Microsoft's .NET Framework, which is a suite of software meant for developing Windows applications. Today, however, C# is used in apps across multiple platforms and is a popular language for video game developers. It is still being developed by Microsoft today, and is used by many programmers.</p>
