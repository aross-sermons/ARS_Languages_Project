            <p>Lisp is a <em>recursive</em> programming language developed for interpreting and manipulating lists of data. It was <strong>created in 1960 by John McCarthy</strong> who worked at MIT at the time. Standing for LISt Processing, Lisp uses a stack-like structure to perform operations on data. Its especially good for AI and machine learning applications. Since its creation, it has branched into many 'dialects' and has gained community support in the form of an <em>open source</em> wiki. People are still developing and implementing new flavors of Lisp to this day. These are mostly used for machine learning, mathematic problems, and language experimentation.</p>
