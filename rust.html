            <p>Rust is an <em>open-source</em> programming language made to solve issues faced by C languages. It was <strong>created in 2006 by Graydon Hoare</strong>, who was frustrated with the amount of memory errors in C languages. To solve this problem, Hoare designed Rust to automate memory handling througn an <em>ownership system</em>. This saves time and complexity for programmers, who no longer have to manually address and deaddress memory locations. Today, millions of developers use Rust as a fast, stable alternative to C. It is actively developed by many contributors and a team at Mozilla, and is used by Amazon, the U.S. Government, and even in microcontrollers.</p>
